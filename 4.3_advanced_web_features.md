##添加 HTTP/HTTPS 通道安全

如果您的应用程序同时支持HTTP和HTTPS，你要求特定的URL只能使用HTTPS，这时可以直接使用```<intercept-url>```的```requires-channel ```属性：


```xml
<http>
<intercept-url pattern="/secure/**" access="ROLE_USER" requires-channel="https"/>
<intercept-url pattern="/**" access="ROLE_USER" requires-channel="any"/>
...
</http>
```

使用上面的配置，如果用户访问到匹配```/secure/**```规则的URL，如果使用了HTTP，他们将首先被重定向到HTTPS的URL.

>如果要了解通道处理器怎么实现的，请查看```ChannelProcessingFilter ```和相关类的API文档.
>

该选项可选值为"http", "https" 或者 "any"，使用"any"意思是使用HTTP或者HTTPS均可。
如果应用程序使用HTTP和/或HTTPS非标准的端口，您可以指定如下端口映射的列表：:

```
<http>
...
<port-mappings>
	<port-mapping http="9080" https="9443"/>
</port-mappings>
</http>
```

需要注意的是，为了实现真正的安全，应用程序不应该使用HTTP或在HTTP和HTTPS之间切换。它应该在由HTTPS开始（让用户进入一个HTTPS URL），并一直使用安全连接，以避免被进行中间人攻击的可能。

##Session Management

###Detecting Timeouts

You can configure Spring Security to detect the submission of an invalid session ID and redirect the user to an appropriate URL. This is achieved through the session-management element:

```xml
<http>
...
<session-management invalid-session-url="/invalidSession.htm" />
</http>
```

Note that if you use this mechanism to detect session timeouts, it may falsely report an error if the user logs out and then logs back in without closing the browser. This is because the session cookie is not cleared when you invalidate the session and will be resubmitted even if the user has logged out. You may be able to explicitly delete the JSESSIONID cookie on logging out, for example by using the following syntax in the logout handler:

```xml
<http>
<logout delete-cookies="JSESSIONID" />
</http>
```
Unfortunately this can’t be guaranteed to work with every servlet container, so you will need to test it in your environment

>if you are running your application behind a proxy, you may also be able to remove the session cookie by configuring the proxy server. For example, using Apache HTTPD’s mod_headers, the following directive would delete the JSESSIONID cookie by expiring it in the response to a logout request (assuming the application is deployed under the path /tutorial):

```xml
<LocationMatch "/tutorial/logout">
Header always set Set-Cookie "JSESSIONID=;Path=/tutorial;Expires=Thu, 01 Jan 1970  00:00:00 GMT"
</LocationMatch>
```

###Concurrent Session Control

If you wish to place constraints on a single user’s ability to log in to your application, Spring Security supports this out of the box with the following simple additions. First you need to add the following listener to your web.xml file to keep Spring Security updated about session lifecycle events:

```xml
<listener>
<listener-class>
	org.springframework.security.web.session.HttpSessionEventPublisher
</listener-class>
</listener>
```
Then add the following lines to your application context:

```xml
<http>
...
<session-management>
	<concurrency-control max-sessions="1" />
</session-management>
</http>
```

This will prevent a user from logging in multiple times - a second login will cause the first to be invalidated. Often you would prefer to prevent a second login, in which case you can use

```xml
<http>
...
<session-management>
	<concurrency-control max-sessions="1" error-if-maximum-exceeded="true" />
</session-management>
</http>
```

The second login will then be rejected. By "rejected", we mean that the user will be sent to the authentication-failure-url if form-based login is being used. If the second authentication takes place through another non-interactive mechanism, such as "remember-me", an "unauthorized" (401) error will be sent to the client. If instead you want to use an error page, you can add the attribute session-authentication-error-url to the session-management element.

If you are using a customized authentication filter for form-based login, then you have to configure concurrent session control support explicitly. More details can be found in the Session Management chapter.

###Session Fixation Attack Protection

Session fixation attacks are a potential risk where it is possible for a malicious attacker to create a session by accessing a site, then persuade another user to log in with the same session (by sending them a link containing the session identifier as a parameter, for example). Spring Security protects against this automatically by creating a new session or otherwise changing the session ID when a user logs in. If you don’t require this protection, or it conflicts with some other requirement, you can control the behavior using the session-fixation-protection attribute on <session-management>, which has four options

- none - Don’t do anything. The original session will be retained.
- newSession - Create a new "clean" session, without copying the existing session data (Spring Security-related attributes will still be copied).
- migrateSession - Create a new session and copy all existing session attributes to the new session. This is the default in Servlet 3.0 or older containers.
- changeSessionId - Do not create a new session. Instead, use the session fixation protection provided by the Servlet container (HttpServletRequest#changeSessionId()). This option is only available in Servlet 3.1 (Java EE 7) and newer containers. Specifying it in older containers will result in an exception. This is the default in Servlet 3.1 and newer containers.

When session fixation protection occurs, it results in a SessionFixationProtectionEvent being published in the application context. If you use changeSessionId, this protection will also result in any javax.servlet.http.HttpSessionIdListener s being notified, so use caution if your code listens for both events. See the Session Management chapter for additional information.

###OpenID Support

The namespace supports OpenID login either instead of, or in addition to normal form-based login, with a simple change:

```xml
<http>
<intercept-url pattern="/**" access="ROLE_USER" />
<openid-login />
</http>
```
You should then register yourself with an OpenID provider (such as myopenid.com), and add the user information to your in-memory <user-service> :

```xml
<user name="http://jimi.hendrix.myopenid.com/" authorities="ROLE_USER" />
```

You should be able to login using the myopenid.com site to authenticate. It is also possible to select a specific UserDetailsService bean for use OpenID by setting the user-service-ref attribute on the openid-login element. See the previous section on authentication providers for more information. Note that we have omitted the password attribute from the above user configuration, since this set of user data is only being used to load the authorities for the user. A random password will be generate internally, preventing you from accidentally using this user data as an authentication source elsewhere in your configuration.

###Attribute Exchange

Support for OpenID attribute exchange. As an example, the following configuration would attempt to retrieve the email and full name from the OpenID provider, for use by the application:

```xml
<openid-login>
<attribute-exchange>
	<openid-attribute name="email" type="http://axschema.org/contact/email" required="true"/>
	<openid-attribute name="name" type="http://axschema.org/namePerson"/>
</attribute-exchange>
</openid-login>
```

The "type" of each OpenID attribute is a URI, determined by a particular schema, in this case http://axschema.org/. If an attribute must be retrieved for successful authentication, the required attribute can be set. The exact schema and attributes supported will depend on your OpenID provider. The attribute values are returned as part of the authentication process and can be accessed afterwards using the following code:

```java
OpenIDAuthenticationToken token =
	(OpenIDAuthenticationToken)SecurityContextHolder.getContext().getAuthentication();
List<OpenIDAttribute> attributes = token.getAttributes();
```

The OpenIDAttribute contains the attribute type and the retrieved value (or values in the case of multi-valued attributes). We’ll see more about how the SecurityContextHolder class is used when we look at core Spring Security components in the technical overview chapter. Multiple attribute exchange configurations are also be supported, if you wish to use multiple identity providers. You can supply multiple attribute-exchange elements, using an identifier-matcher attribute on each. This contains a regular expression which will be matched against the OpenID identifier supplied by the user. See the OpenID sample application in the codebase for an example configuration, providing different attribute lists for the Google, Yahoo and MyOpenID providers.

###Response Headers

For additional information on how to customize the headers element refer to the Chapter 17, Security HTTP Response Headers section of the reference.

###Adding in Your Own Filters

If you’ve used Spring Security before, you’ll know that the framework maintains a chain of filters in order to apply its services. You may want to add your own filters to the stack at particular locations or use a Spring Security filter for which there isn’t currently a namespace configuration option (CAS, for example). Or you might want to use a customized version of a standard namespace filter, such as the UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter which is created by the <form-login> element, taking advantage of some of the extra configuration options which are available by using the bean explicitly. How can you do this with namespace configuration, since the filter chain is not directly exposed?

The order of the filters is always strictly enforced when using the namespace. When the application context is being created, the filter beans are sorted by the namespace handling code and the standard Spring Security filters each have an alias in the namespace and a well-known position.

>In previous versions, the sorting took place after the filter instances had been created, during post-processing of the application context. In version 3.0+ the sorting is now done at the bean metadata level, before the classes have been instantiated. This has implications for how you add your own filters to the stack as the entire filter list must be known during the parsing of the <http> element, so the syntax has changed slightly in 3.0.
>

The filters, aliases and namespace elements/attributes which create the filters are shown in Table 4.1, “Standard Filter Aliases and Ordering”. The filters are listed in the order in which they occur in the filter chain.

Table 4.1. Standard Filter Aliases and Ordering

|                   Alias               |               Filter Class            |               Namespace Element or Attribute             |
|                    ---                   |              ---                            |                                        ---                                                |
| CHANNEL_FILTER          |```ChannelProcessingFilter```|```http/intercept-url@requires-channel```|
| SECURITY_CONTEXT_FILTER |```SecurityContextPersistenceFilter``` | ```http```|
| CONCURRENT_SESSION_FILTER  |```ConcurrentSessionFilter``` |```session-management/concurrency-control``` | 
| HEADERS_FILTER | ```HeaderWriterFilter``` | ```http/headers```|
| CSRF_FILTER | ```CsrfFilter``` | ```http/csrf``` |
| LOGOUT_FILTER | ```LogoutFilter``` | ```http/logout```|
| X509_FILTER | ```X509AuthenticationFilter``` | ```http/x509``` |
| PRE_AUTH_FILTER | ```AbstractPreAuthenticatedProcessingFilter```  Subclasses| N/A|
| CAS_FILTER | ```CasAuthenticationFilter``` | N/A |
| FORM_LOGIN_FILTER | ```UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter``` | ```http/form-login``` |
| BASIC_AUTH_FILTER | ```BasicAuthenticationFilter``` | ```http/http-basic``` |
| SERVLET_API_SUPPORT_FILTER | ```SecurityContextHolderAwareRequestFilter``` | ```http/@servlet-api-provision``` |
| JAAS_API_SUPPORT_FILTER | ```JaasApiIntegrationFilter``` | ```http/@jaas-api-provision``` |
| REMEMBER_ME_FILTER | ```RememberMeAuthenticationFilter``` | ```http/remember-me``` |
| ANONYMOUS_FILTER | ```AnonymousAuthenticationFilter``` | ```http/anonymous``` |
| SESSION_MANAGEMENT_FILTER | ```SessionManagementFilter``` | ```session-management``` |
| EXCEPTION_TRANSLATION_FILTER | ```ExceptionTranslationFilter``` | ```http``` |
| FILTER_SECURITY_INTERCEPTOR | ```FilterSecurityInterceptor``` | ```http``` |
| SWITCH_USER_FILTER | ```SwitchUserFilter``` | N/A |

You can add your own filter to the stack, using the custom-filter element and one of these names to specify the position your filter should appear at:

```xml
<http>
<custom-filter position="FORM_LOGIN_FILTER" ref="myFilter" />
</http>

<beans:bean id="myFilter" class="com.mycompany.MySpecialAuthenticationFilter"/>
```

You can also use the after or before attributes if you want your filter to be inserted before or after another filter in the stack. The names "FIRST" and "LAST" can be used with the position attribute to indicate that you want your filter to appear before or after the entire stack, respectively.

>If you are inserting a custom filter which may occupy the same position as one of the standard filters created by the namespace then it’s important that you don’t include the namespace versions by mistake. Remove any elements which create filters whose functionality you want to replace.
Note that you can’t replace filters which are created by the use of the <http> element itself - SecurityContextPersistenceFilter, ExceptionTranslationFilter or FilterSecurityInterceptor. Some other filters are added by default, but you can disable them. An AnonymousAuthenticationFilter is added by default and unless you have session-fixation protection disabled, a SessionManagementFilter will also be added to the filter chain.

If you’re replacing a namespace filter which requires an authentication entry point (i.e. where the authentication process is triggered by an attempt by an unauthenticated user to access to a secured resource), you will need to add a custom entry point bean too.


Setting a Custom AuthenticationEntryPoint

If you aren’t using form login, OpenID or basic authentication through the namespace, you may want to define an authentication filter and entry point using a traditional bean syntax and link them into the namespace, as we’ve just seen. The corresponding AuthenticationEntryPoint can be set using the entry-point-ref attribute on the <http> element.

The CAS sample application is a good example of the use of custom beans with the namespace, including this syntax. If you aren’t familiar with authentication entry points, they are discussed in the technical overview chapter.
